# Casazium

**Casazium** is an independent suite of developer tools and lightweight software products — built to help solo builders and small teams launch faster without bloat or complexity.

Our mission is to make modern, privacy-conscious tools that are easy to integrate, self-host, and scale — from MVP to production.
